## FAQ

### What if all my accounts have different passwords?

That's simple, just put a coloumn between them in the usernames text file, like so:

```txt
Account1
Account2
Account3
Account4:IHaveADifferentPassword
Account5
```

### Does this work on all modes?

Yes, just change the mode in the config.json file, no shortforms. To test if your input would work try '/server your_input' on pika before entering it to avoid confusion.

### Where is the usernames text file & config json?

They will be created with prompts on your first run. However, you can create the usernames.txt yourself.
